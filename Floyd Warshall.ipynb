    "1. You can't have the k loop on the inside, and i, j on the outside. If so, you can run into uncalculated d(x,k) and d(k,y) values. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You don't need to keep both dk and dk-1 at each iteration. you can just use one matrix. this means you could be using d(x, k, k) values rather than d(x, k, k - 1) as they get replaced, but they are the same thing since the path will include k either way."
